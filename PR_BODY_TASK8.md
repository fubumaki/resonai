# Task 8: UX Polish & Copy - 10-Trial Session Structure

## Overview
Enhanced the practice experience with clearer messaging about the 10-trial session structure and improved user guidance throughout the practice flow.

## Key Changes

### Practice Session Structure
- **Clear session context**: Added prominent "Practice Session" header with progress messaging
- **Session-aware coach tips**: Coach now provides context-aware feedback based on session progress
- **Session completion flow**: Clear messaging when sessions are complete with option to start new sessions
- **Progress visualization**: Enhanced progress bar with descriptive text showing trial completion status

### Coach Messaging Improvements
- **Welcome message**: New users see "Welcome! Complete 10 trials to finish this practice session"
- **Progress encouragement**: "Great progress! X of 10 trials completed" messaging
- **Near-completion motivation**: "Almost there! X trials left. Keep your technique steady"
- **Session completion**: "Session complete! Review your progress chart and start a new session anytime"

### UI Enhancements
- **Session reset functionality**: "New Session" button appears when 10 trials are completed
- **Trial context**: Each trial now shows "Part of 10-trial session" badge
- **Dynamic status text**: Real-time updates showing session progress and completion status

### Documentation Updates
- **README**: Updated feature description to mention "10-trial practice sessions"
- **Developer handbook**: Added note about session structure for developers
- **Coach copy library**: Added session-specific messaging templates

## User Experience Impact
- **Clearer expectations**: Users now understand they're working through a structured 10-trial session
- **Better motivation**: Progress tracking and completion messaging encourages continued practice
- **Reduced confusion**: Session-aware coach tips provide more relevant guidance
- **Improved flow**: Clear session completion and reset options prevent user confusion

## Technical Notes
- Session progress is tracked in component state and persists during the practice session
- Coach tips now receive session progress as a parameter for context-aware messaging
- All messaging follows accessibility guidelines with proper ARIA labels and live regions
- No inline styles used - all styling follows project CSP requirements
