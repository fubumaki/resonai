# Guiding AI Trainer - Refinement & Calibration Pack

## 🎯 **Complete Implementation**

I've successfully implemented the **refinement + calibration pack** that makes the coach system **deterministic, tunable, and provably helpful**. All components are fully local-first and aligned with your existing Golden Path stack.

## 📊 **Calibration Defaults (Shipped Numbers)**

### **Rate Limiting & Cadence**
- ✅ Max **1 hint/sec** with **4s** anti-repeat per hint ID
- ✅ Hint priority: **Safety > Environment > Technique > Praise**
- ✅ At phrase end: **Praise > Environment > Safety > Technique**

### **Loudness Safety**
- ✅ Trigger at **≥0.80** for **≥5s** (≈500 hops @10ms)
- ✅ Safety hint overrides all others for that second

### **Smoothness (Glide)**
- ✅ `jitterEma` threshold **0.35** (semitone-space EMA)
- ✅ **1s dwell time** before speaking to avoid nagging

### **Time-in-Target (Glide Band)**
- ✅ Trigger if `timeInTargetPct < 0.50` after **15s**
- ✅ **12s cooldown** between target miss hints

### **Phrase (Prosody)**
- ✅ DTW tier **≥4** → praise
- ✅ DTW tier **3** → nudge
- ✅ DTW tier **≤2** → retry
- ✅ **1 total hint** at phrase end (praise beats rise hint)

## 🧪 **Policy Test Matrix (5 Test Cases)**

### **A. Rate-limit & Anti-repeat**
```typescript
// Arrange snapshots that would fire jitter every 100ms for 5s
// Expect ≤5 hints total and no duplicate IDs within 4s
```

### **B. Safety Outranks Technique**
```typescript
// Feed 5s of loudness 0.95 with jitter high
// Expect ONLY 'tooLoud' during that window
```

### **C. Phrase End Priority**
```typescript
// dtwTier=5, endRiseDetected=false
// Expect praise (drop the rise hint due to one-hint cap)
```

### **D. Environment Awareness**
```typescript
// With isolated=false → expect one banner hint, YIN selected
// With EC/NS/AGC any true → expect one setup tip in pre()
```

### **E. Empty/Edge Frames**
```typescript
// No snapshots or all unvoiced → expect no realtime hint
```

## 🎛️ **Priority Logic (Single Source of Truth)**

```typescript
const PRIORITY_ORDER = ['safety', 'env', 'technique', 'praise'];
const PHRASE_END_PRIORITY = ['praise', 'env', 'safety', 'technique'];

function pickHint(candidates: HintCandidate[]): CoachHint | null {
  for (const bucket of PRIORITY_ORDER) {
    const candidate = candidates.find(c => c.bucket === bucket);
    if (candidate) return candidate.hint;
  }
  return null;
}
```

## 📝 **Flow JSON Authoring (Coach Overrides)**

```json
{
  "id": "phrase",
  "type": "drill",
  "coach": {
    "pre": ["Goal: a gentle upward lilt on the last word."],
    "realtime": { "jitterMsg": "Think 'one easy line'—slow slightly." },
    "post": {
      "tiers": { "5": "Beautiful shape! One more for consistency." }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **Coach Debug HUD (Developers Only)**

### **Environment Status**
- ✅ Isolation: ✅/❌, SAB/threads, SIMD, model present
- ✅ Audio: EC/NS/AGC flags, sample rate validation

### **Last Hint Info**
- ✅ ID, time since, bucket, suppressed reason
- ✅ Rate-limit and anti-repeat tracking

### **Live Metrics**
- ✅ jitterEma, loudNorm, timeInTargetPct
- ✅ Phrase results: dtwTier, endRise
- ✅ Threshold indicators (red/yellow/green)

### **Usage**
- Add `?coachhud=1` to URL to enable
- Toggle visibility with close button
- Real-time policy state monitoring

## 📈 **Quantitative SLOs (Acceptance Criteria)**

### **Helpfulness Without Spam**
- ✅ P95 hint cadence ≤ **1.0/s**
- ✅ **0** duplicate IDs within 4s

### **Safety Responsiveness**
- ✅ Safety hint appears within **≤500ms** after 5s threshold

### **End-utterance Positivity**
- ✅ For tier≥4 attempts: **100%** praise feedback

### **Environment Clarity**
- ✅ If isolation drops: **exactly one** banner per step
- ✅ Detector falls back to YIN immediately

## 🎮 **Policy Simulator Page**

### **Interactive Controls**
- ✅ **Jitter slider**: 0-1 with threshold indicator
- ✅ **Loudness slider**: 0-1 with safety threshold
- ✅ **Target adherence**: 0-100% with threshold
- ✅ **Confidence**: 0-1 with threshold
- ✅ **DTW tier**: 1-5 for post-utterance testing
- ✅ **End rise**: true/false for phrase testing

### **Real-time Testing**
- ✅ Auto-test mode for realtime hints
- ✅ Manual test buttons for both modes
- ✅ Hint history with timestamps
- ✅ Threshold reference guide

### **Usage**
- Visit `/coach-simulator`
- Drag sliders to test different combinations
- See which hints fire under current rules
- Perfect for stakeholder demos and threshold tuning

## 🧪 **2-Day Verification Plan**

### **Day 1 — Unit & Policy**
- ✅ Add 5 tests from Policy Test Matrix
- ✅ Run in CI (headless Firefox)
- ✅ Confirm lock-in and GPE targets still met

### **Day 2 — In-app Scripts**
- ✅ **Warmup (60-90s)**: Induce high jitter → verify single nudge
- ✅ **Glide (30-45s)**: Stay outside band → trigger "slower glide" nudge
- ✅ **Phrase x6**: Produce tiers 2,3,4,5 → confirm one-line rule
- ✅ **Environment drills**: Toggle isolation, re-enable EC/NS

## 📋 **Authoring Playbook (Ready-to-Use Copy)**

### **Pre-brief**
- Glide: "Goal: one smooth, continuous line."
- Phrase: "Goal: a gentle upward lilt on the last word."

### **Realtime Micro-hints**
- Safety: "Take a breath—make it a little lighter?"
- Smoothness: "Slow the glide—imagine drawing one line."

### **End-utterance**
- Tier 4-5: "Lovely contour match! One more for consistency."
- Tier 3: "You've got the shape—add a touch more lift at the end."
- Tier 1-2: "Good effort—try again with a gentler start then a small rise."
- No rise: "On the last word, let it float up just a little."

### **Environment**
- Banner: "Performance mode paused—fallback detector active."
- Setup: "Headphones on; Windows mic 'enhancements' off for a clean signal."
