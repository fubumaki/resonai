interface ComponentProps {
  // Define clear, typed interfaces
  metrics: AudioMetrics;
  isVisible: boolean;
  className?: string;
}

// Implement comprehensive error handling
try {
  await initializeAudioProcessing();
} catch (error) {
  setError('Audio processing unavailable - using basic recording');
  // Provide graceful fallbacks
}

// Include accessibility attributes
<div
  role="status"
  aria-live="polite"
  aria-atomic="true"
  aria-label="Real-time practice metrics"
>
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

### **Testing Requirements:**
- **Unit Tests** - 100% coverage for new components and hooks
- **E2E Tests** - Complete user workflow validation
- **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG AA compliance verification
- **Performance Tests** - 60fps frame rate and <5% CPU usage validation

### **Architecture Patterns:**
```typescript
// Custom hooks for complex state management
export function useAudioProcessing(mediaStream: MediaStream | null) {
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState<AudioMetrics>(defaultMetrics);
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Implementation with proper cleanup
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      // Cleanup audio resources
      audioContext?.close();
      cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrame);
    };
  }, []);
  
  return { metrics, isActive, error, start, stop };
}
```
