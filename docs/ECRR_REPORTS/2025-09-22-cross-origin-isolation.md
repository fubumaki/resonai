# ECRR Report - ECRR-01 Cross-Origin Isolation Hardening

- **Date / Author**: 2025-09-22 - ChatGPT Agent
- **Scope**: `public/sw.js`, `playwright/tests/isolation_headers.spec.ts`, `docs/audit/resonai-audit-response.md`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`

---

## Examine (facts)
- **URL/build**: local checkout `third_party/resonai` @ `pnpm playwright test isolation_headers.spec.ts --project=firefox`
- **crossOriginIsolated**: `true` (validated via Playwright firefox spec run)
- **Mic settings**: Not exercised (scope limited to isolation infrastructure)
- **Flow integrity**: Practice flow not exercised in this cycle (offline isolation focus)
- **Local data footprint**: Headless Playwright run only; no persistent caches created

---

## Clean (actions)
- SW/caches cleared: Not required (headless session)
- IndexedDB/localStorage reset: Not applicable (no persistent browser context)
- Port killed/restarted: Service worker lifecycle driven by Playwright test harness only
- Agent worker state: running; `.agent/LOCK` absent
- Other cleanups: Verified dependency graph (`pnpm list onnxruntime-web`)

---

## Results
- **Before -> After**: Offline reloads now retain COOP/COEP headers through SW cache; Playwright isolation spec expanded to cover `/` and `/try`; audit checklist includes isolation verification gate
- **Regressions**: None observed during spec run
- **Follow-ups**: Optional manual Firefox screenshot for handbook; monitor `onnxruntime-web` bundle size in next perf audit

## Role
- **Who**: ChatGPT Agent
- **Responsibilities this cycle**: Validate isolation enforcement, ensure automated proof recorded, document ECRR evidence
- **Artifacts produced**: Playwright run output, audit checklist update, this ECRR report
- **Handoff notes**: Ready for codex-local or QA Scribe to capture manual Firefox evidence if required by release checklist
